Airport Qualification Category C

2. HAZARD/DEFICIENCIES
TERRAIN
Airport elevation is 968ft.
Flat terrain and a big river just before the threshold  RWY 05

DANGEROUS GOODS
Someone needs to watch cargo loading to avoid carriage of dangerous goods

RWY INCURSION
Due military and GA traffic a RWY incursion can occur at any time

BAD WX
Bad weather is poorly reported. Pilots are to take extreme caution. Dust may lead to a sudden deterioration in reported visibility with little or no warning from ATC and "Habubs" can close an airport.

ATC 
Controllers are not vigilant and sometimes forget clearances and traffic positions. Confirm clearances and keep a close listening watch for other traffic. ATC standard is sometimes poor and erratic. Crew should question and clarify clearances given.

UNRELIABLE NAVAIDS 
In the event of contradictory or inaccurate information being perceived such as a NAVAID failure, the approach must be immediately terminated and a missed approach flown (unless in visual conditions, stabilised and positioned to land).

ALTIMETER ERROR
During an ILS approach the altimeter may read approximately 100 feet low at the OM due to high temperature error.

BIRD HAZARD
Bird Hazards are encountered anywhere within Chad airspace from ground level to 15,000 ft at all times. Large birds up to 7 kg are common.

TCAS WARNINGS
Pilot reports indicate TCAS warnings on approach due to close proximity military or GA traffic.

RUNWAY CONDITION
The runway surface is undulating which loads the nose wheel. Braking action is degraded in wet conditions, particularly on heavy rubber deposits in the touchdown area of RWY. Most approach, runway and taxiway lighting are often unserviceable.

TAXI AND PARKING
Pilots are to exercise caution when taxiing in the apron area. Expect parking in front of taxiway D. There is no marshaler and park clear of the vehicle road  markings.Taxiway and apron line markings are poor and may differ from those depicted in the Jeppesen charts. 

Paved areas outside continuous yellow lines are non-load bearing. Equipment clearance lines around the parking bays may be less than required. In the apron area light aircraft and other equipment may pose a taxi hazard.
If obstacle clearance is in doubt, stop the aircraft and request a wing walker.

3. WEATHER
The climate of Chad varies from tropical along the south to arid inland. Chad has two rainy seasons: From October to December, expect short durations of rain. 

4. ATC
Overflight Clearances
Crew can expect to be asked for overflight clearances prior to FIR boundaries. 
All overflight clearances can be found in the flight folder.

ARRIVAL
Runway 05 is primarily used for landing and takeoff. NDJ is primarily procedural control with radar backup. Expect to get cleared for an ILS RWY 05 and be cleared direct via RELEN.

Crew should not accept ATC clearances to descend below the published descent altitudes. Follow the minimum altitudes as stipulated on the Jeppesen Chart of the relevant STAR and Approach procedures.

DEPARTURE
Call TWR for surface conditions and start clearance giving A/C REG, POB, ENDURANCE and REQUESTED LEVEL.

Airport Qualification Category C

2. HAZARD/DEFICIENCIES
TERRAIN
Airport elevation is 1789ft.
Hills around initial approach position RWY 09 and final RWY 27

TCAS WARNINGS
Pilot reports indicate TCAS warnings on approach due to close proximity military or GA traffic.

RUNWAY CONDITION
The runway is 30m wide and gives a high illusion. Braking action is degraded in wet conditions, particularly on heavy rubber deposits in the touchdown area of RWY. There is no approach, runway and taxiway lighting.

TAXI AND PARKING
Pilots are to exercise caution when taxiing in the apron area. Expect parking parallel to the hanger written ABECHE facing East. There is no marshaller and park clear of the vehicle road  markings. Taxiway and apron line markings are poor and may not make sense. Taxi slowly and ensure the A/C is clear of all equipment, aircraft and obstacles.

Paved areas outside continuous yellow lines are non-load bearing. Equipment clearance lines around the parking bays may be less than required. In the apron area light aircraft and other equipment may pose a taxi hazard.
If obstacle clearance is in doubt, stop the aircraft and request a wing walker.
